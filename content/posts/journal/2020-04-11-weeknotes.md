- This weeks [CSS Tricks Newsletter](https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/193-new-colors-in-css-and-a-css-only-carousel/) contains an overwhelming amount of useful tricks and hints.

While watching some *An Event Apart* videos, I got reminded what a big fan of the *[A Book Apart (ABA)](https://abookapart.com/collections/books)* publications I am. I got hooked to their books from the start and immediately purchased the first two issues, which was *"[HTML for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)"*, by Jeremy Keith and Rachel Andrew, and *"[CSS3 for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers)"* by Dan Cederholm. To get an overview for myself, here are the titles I own and the ones I would like to add to my small collection. I have:

- HTML For Web Designers
- CSS3 For Web Designers
- The Elements of Content Strategy
- Responsive Web Design
- Designing For Emotion
- On Web Typography
- Get Ready for CSS Grid Layout
- Git for Humans
- Design for Real Life
