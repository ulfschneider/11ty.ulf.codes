title: Fluid videos with my adaption of FitVids
---
Embedded videos are not automatically responsive or fluid. They come with a fixed setting for width and height. To make them responsive while keeping aspect ratio, typically they are embedded into a wrapper element. The wrapper receives some clever padding and positioning, and as a last step the fixed dimensions are removed from the video. The technique has been described by Thierry Koblentz in his *A List Apart* article "[Creating Intrinsic Ratios for Video](https://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video/)" in 2009.

To achieve this kind of manipulation automatically for all videos on your website, you have to run a script. Therefore I came up with my own tiny version of the [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com) script. FitVids is Dave Rupert´s implementation of the described algorithm. It has jQuery as a dependency, which I wanted to avoid. Therefore I picked up Dave´s code and simplified it to my needs. No dependencies anymore. 

For correct initial rendering on small screens, **it is important to set a max-width for IFrames in your CSS,** otherwise your text might be rendered too tall on those small screens. That´s because initially, before the script does its work, the IFrame might have too much width and breaks your layout. Setting it to a max-width of 100% ensures it stays within desired limits. However, the adjusting script needs to run afterwards, because otherwise the aspect ratio of the videos would be broken.

iframe {
  max-width: 100%;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Place the script on your website by putting it into a file, e.g. `fit-vids.js`, and reference it via `<script src="/.../fit-vids.js"></script>`. Here it is:
