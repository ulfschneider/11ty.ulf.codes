- [Sarah Fossheim](https://fossheim.io/) publishes her new project website [ethicaldesign.guide](https://ethicaldesign.guide/). *"… Ethical Design Guide is made to share resources on how to create ethical products that don't cause harm."* 

I did a huge overhaul of my website:

- Changed the page layout to a centered text layout. It feels to me like the centering is letting the text appear more sublime, by providing balanced whitespace around it. I think it makes the reading experience more pleasant. I still didn´t use `flex-box` or `grid` for the layout, because collapsing margins are important to me when designing a website for mostly text—and `flex` and `grid` don´t offer that. 
- Changed the typeface from Georgia/Sans-Serif/Monospace to [iA Writer Quattro](https://ia.net/writer/blog/a-typographic-christmas), a four-spaced typeface (so, nearly monospace). *"… It shares similarities with a proportional typeface. At the same time it retains a lot of the technical virtues of the classic typewriter fonts using wider gaps between the words and giving each letter more room that a classic, fully proportional face."* The folks at iA gave most letters the same space, except: some letters like i,j,l received 50% of the normal letterspace; f, r, and t received 75%; m and w got 150%.
- Reduced the amount of information that´s presented in the titles. E.g. I´m not showing subtitles anymore. The only things left are the author (if any), the date of writing, and the tagging.
