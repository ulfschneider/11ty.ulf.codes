- Emil pictured the [virus](/2020-03-18-emil-pictured-the-coronavirus).
- I get the case counts from The Johns Hopkins [Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). At the end of this week we are counting 22.000 infected people in Germany, 84 people died. Worldwide, we have 307.000 people infected and 13.049 people died. 
- The Washington Post: "[How outbreaks like Coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to flatten the curve](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)," by Harry Stevens. A very good explanation with comprehensive simulations.
- [Epidemic Calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html).
- A set of free [Coronavirus awareness icons](https://www.iconfinder.com/p/coronavirus-awareness-icons) from iconfinder.
- [How design tells a story](https://twitter.com/tomjolly/status/1240381892077277187?s=21) from [Andrew Sondern](https://standardregular.com/Andrew-Sondern), Art Director of The New York Times.
- Another great page: "[Paul liebt Paula](https://paulliebtpaula.de/ueber-uns/)." I found it on my chase for Lightroom presets, because during this week I discovered that unfortunately [VSCO](https://vsco.co) is not in the Lightroom Preset Business anymore.
- Alternatives for VSCO: [Hafenliebe Presets](https://hafenliebe.education/presets/) by Björn Lexius. I like it that Björn has only a limited number of color and bw presets which are to be meant as a starting point for further adjustment. Björn´s presets are currently my favourite. More alternatives are [RNI](https://reallyniceimages.com),  and maybe [Paul liebt Paula](https://paulliebtpaula.de/presets/).
- Debugging CSS with <code>* {outline: 1px solid red;}</code> is better than setting <code>* {border: 1px solid red;}</code>, because outline doesn´t affect the box model!
