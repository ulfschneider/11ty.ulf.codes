Oliver Sch√∂ndorfer makes some points in his article "[How to pick a Typeface for User Interface and App Design?](https://www.zeichenschatz.net/typografie/how-to-pick-a-typeface-for-user-interface-and-app-design.html)"

- **Functional text:** is short text. Labels, alerts, navigational elements, captions, and the like.
- **Clarity:** Make the Il1 test (capital I, lower case l, and the number one). If these three shapes are easy to distinguish you found a good typeface.
- **Open shapes:** The apertures should be open (like for c and e). Helvetica has closed apertures, while PT Sans has open apertures.
- **Reduced contrast:** Look for a typeface with even, sturdy strokes. This does not necessarily mean it has to be a sans-serif (some subtle slab serifs could work as well), but in most cases it might be.
- **Set things legible:** Letters set in all caps are [harder to read](https://ulf.codes/2020-07-21-how-we-read/).
