- Learned from the [Accessible Footnotes](https://www.sitepoint.com/accessible-footnotes-css/) article, there is a [:target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) pseudo-class in CSS that allows select and to style a targeted element on a page. *Nice.*
- [Take five](https://madmurphy.github.io/takefive.css/), a semantically-consistent pure-CSS slide renderer.
- A calendar with three lines of CSS, from [Calendar Tricks](https://calendartricks.com/a-calendar-in-three-lines-of-css/).
