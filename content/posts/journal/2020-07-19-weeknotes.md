- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi) is an algorithm to calculate fluid type size for responsive websites. It´s made by James Gilyead and Trys Mudford. There’s no program or dependency to install. James and Trys have a [Fluid Type Scale Calculator](https://utopia.fyi/calculator) and a [CSS Generator](https://utopia.fyi/generator). Here is a [sample page](https://utopia.netlify.app) for how it works.
- To improve initial load speed and also for aesthetics, I changed the site to use only system fonts. This got me rid of 200kb initial load. The site is now using *Plain Old Georgia* for all serif text and the system sans-serif/monospace for everything else. Sometimes it´s astonishing how good an old and well-established typeface can look.
- Mark Boulton has [Arpona](https://floodfonts.com/arpona/?utm_source=markboulton&utm_medium=email) in his type specimen newsletter. Beautiful, the type as well as the specimen. The designer of the type is Felix Braden. 
- CSS Tricks on [memorizing scroll position across page loads](https://css-tricks.com/memorize-scroll-position-across-page-loads/), which is based on Hakim El Hattabs initial [tweet](https://twitter.com/hakimel/status/1262337065670316033).
- I´m currently taking the free [Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com) course which is made by [Matej Latin](https://matejlatin.co.uk).
