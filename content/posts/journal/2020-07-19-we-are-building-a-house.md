title: We are building a house
permalink: /journal/{{ page.fileSlug }}/
---
Our weed-covered land is starting to transform. This house project might take a time of nearly ten years in the end. We bought the property in 2019 from the city of Paderborn. Being elegible for buying required us to be on a waiting list for six to seven years. During 2019 we selected the builders, which are  [Knecht Fertigkeller](https://www.fertigkeller.de/de/) for the cellar and [Haas Fertigbau](https://haas-fertighaus.de) for the house. Also in 2019 we started to work on the architecture of the house. Now, in July 2020, change is coming!

I´m posting a timeline of images here to document the progress.

## The fine measurement

<figure class="rg:split">
<figcaption>Jul 27, 2020: My brother is doing the fine measurements. We have a problem. The ground is so solid that we cannot bring in the steel posts properly. They go only as deep that it holds like spit-glued. Fortunately our cellar builder is capable enough and willing to go ahead with it.</figcaption>

## The cellar

<figcaption>Aug 7, 2020: The basement plate preparation is ready for the concreting. I have hired a construction expert to help me with the acceptance of the delivered results. Before the concreting starts, he wants to see the steel. The expert is very satisfied with the good quality of the work and of course – I´m glad too! Finally it was the right decision to go with Knecht as the cellar builder. The three men, despite the heat of 33 °C in the afternoon, seem to work without any resting. I can only help them with providing water to drink, a bit of coffee, and some food. I think they earned their weekend well. Because of the heat they are covering the new basement plate with film, so that it doesn´t build out cracks during the hardening period. Next week they are going to finalize the cellar.</figcaption>
