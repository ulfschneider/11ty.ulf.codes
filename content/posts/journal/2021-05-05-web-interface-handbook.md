Excellent resource by Aleksei Baranov. [The Web Interface Handbook](https://imperavi.com/books/web-interface-handbook/) *"is a book about the fundamentals of creating a good web interface. You will find out how to make effective forms, typography, grids, and many other components of web design."*

It´s beautifully crafted with useful examples of what to avoid and what to strive for. One must not agree with everything stated in the book, but it´s worth investigating.
