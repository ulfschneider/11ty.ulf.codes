- [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/), a webfont of the typeface used in Edward Tufte’s books. Free! It is used for example by Jeremy Keith in his [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com). 
- [The Vignelli Canon](/assets/the-vignelli-canon.pdf). As Massimo Vignelli states in the introduction of the book: *"…a useful instrument for a better understanding of typography in Graphic Design. This little book reveals our guidelines – those set by ourselves for ourselves."*
- [Information Management: A Proposal](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) by Tim Berners-Lee in March 1989 is what became later the World Wide Web.
