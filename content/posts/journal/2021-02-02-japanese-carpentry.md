title: Japanese Carpentry
---
Our tiny family is [building a house](/journal/we-are-building-a-house/). We are shortly before moving into the new place and I´m exhausted by the entire process. Building a house drained my batteries. In 2021 I certainly don´t want to spent my time making phone calls and appointments with builders. 

Then I saw this beautiful film^[The film was shared by Dave Rupert with his post "[Traditional Japanese carpentry versus modern times](https://daverupert.com/2021/01/traditional-japanese-carpentry-versus-modern-times/)"] of a japanese carpenter building a wooden house for a family, and I thought by myself, with this guy I would be willing to build another house. 

In my opinion this is how any work should be done. This is how *my work* must be done.
