title: Weeknotes 10
---
- Watched "[Thereabouts 3: Discovering Colombia](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/thereabouts3)" again. It´s the best of the series. I can recommend this film for anyone who is into cycling.
- Restarted my sports routine after two weeks of sickness. Next goal is the [half marathon in Paderborn](https://www.paderborner-osterlauf.de) at the 11th of April. I hope I stay healthy until then and can do something to improve my shape – it´s necessary :-).
- Beautiful page from Oslo-based [Sarah Fossheim](https://fossheim.io). An incredible piece of work to create a [Polaroid camera with CSS gradients only](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-polaroid-camera/). Probably more useful for my daily work is her article [Designing accessible data visualizations](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/accessible-dataviz-design/). Overall, I´m impressed.
- [Priority Guides](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes/), as a content-first alternative to wireframes, is a concept that makes sense to me. Advantages over wireframes, as stated in the *list apart* article: Priority guides are suitable for responsive design, the process is content first, you do not waste time with aesthetics and layout, visual designer creativity is facilitated, a priority guide is similar to html.
- After a discussion with one of our project managers from Mexico I watched Richard Wilkinson: "[How economic inequality harms societies](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson_how_economic_inequality_harms_societies?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)" again. It´s stunning to me how Richard can make the point that our lives suffer – also the lives of the wealthy – if we allow too much of inequality in our societies. Recommended with a ★. 
- How great is the "[Manifesto for Half-Arsed Agile Software Development](https://www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org)" :-). Unfortunately a reality in many cases.
