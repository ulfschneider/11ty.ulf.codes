Hi, I´m Ulf Schneider and this is my website. 

I´m a software developer and agile coach, currently working for the software organization of Diebold Nixdorf in Paderborn, Germany. In 1996 I graduated at the University of Paderborn (Dipl.-Wirt. Inform.). 

Throughout 25 years in the software industry, I was more than ten years with IBM Global Services as a developer and software architect and more than seven years self-employed as an agile coach and trainer. Since 2014 I am employed at Diebold Nixdorf.
