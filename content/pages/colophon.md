This site is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) on a Mac, stored on [Github](https://github.com) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a _Progressive Web App._ The typeface is Georgia for serif text and your computers default sans-serif/monospace for everything else. I write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Compose](/tools/compose/) and the client-side search is powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/).
